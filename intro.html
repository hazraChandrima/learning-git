        <p>Hello, I am Chandrima Hazra, a bit eccentric and homesick. Although I doubt anyone would be reading this 😂<br/>
            My banner image tells much about me, my own world and all that I love. ❤<br/>
            As a student pursuing B Tech in Computer Science and Engg. from NIT Jamshedpur,  India,  I'm a front end web developer currently learning React, Next.JS and backend development. 👩‍💻<br/>
            What  I'm most passionate about : watercolor painting, nature photography, learning piano in the future. I gained my love for the piano from Frederic Chopin's music 🎹<br/>
            I'm also excited about astronomy, chess, drugs and any chemical that is hazardous.🤭<br/>
            In my spare time, I go swimming. 🏊‍♀️</p>
