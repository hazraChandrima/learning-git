//written in main branch

This repository is just made to teach myself Git.

2-7-24,2:31pm : Just learnt:
$ git --version
$ git config --global usesr.name "chandrima-hazra"
$ git config --global user.email "hazrachandrima6@gmail.com"
$ mkdir july-proj 
$ cd july-proj (C:Users\user\july-proj)

Then initialised an empty Git repo in folder july-proj:
$ git init 
then created a naked intro.html file and checked whether the changes I had made was tracked or not:
$ git status
and then staged it to the repository and checked whether the changes I had made was tracked or not: 
$ git add intro.html
$ git status
Then created this README.md file.

2:50pm : Now I've created a crappy-style.css file, to make my intro.html file feel less shameful.
$ git add --all / $ git add -A
This staged both my newly added files into the repository.

3:18pm : Made my first commit into the repo. YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO STAGE YOUR COMMITS FIRST!!!
$ git commit -m "here's my first commit"
Then made a small change in intro.html file and checked the status.
$ git status --short
and it showed M intro.html, M meaning modified.

so you can even commit changes without writing add command, as I am going to do now:
$ git commit -a -m "updated README.md"

to view history of all your commits:
$ git log

created lalala.txt and filled it with rubbish.
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "updated README.md and created lalala.txt"

4:00pm : Now I stuffed in some more rubbish in lalala.txt.
$ git commit -a -m "updated README.md and stuffed some more rubbish in lalala.txt"
I then renamed lalala.txt to rubbish.txt.
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "updated README.md and created lalala.txt"



//written in intro-image branch

4:48pm : I created a new branch named intro-image.
$ git branch intro-image
$ git checkout intro-image

Then I added some relatable chess memes in intro.html.
$ git add --all
$ git status --short
A  chess-meme1.png
A  chess-meme2.jpeg
M  crappy-style.css
M  intro.html

$ git commit -m "added some chess memes in intro.html"
$ git log

ls command gives list of all the files present in the current dir.

5:32pm : made another branch named "just-remembered-something".
$ git checkout -b just-remembered-something
$ git branch

Then I made some changes in intro.html.
$ git commit -a -m "not important to know, just too lazy to type a commit message"
$ git log

Then I merged this branch with the main branch.
Before that I need to switch to the main branch.
$ git checkout main
$ git merge just-remembered-something

Since both branches were now pointing to the same commit, I deleted the just-remembered-something branch.
$ git branch -d just-remembered-something

Now, back to intro-image branch, just made some more changes to the intro.html, style.css and README.md files.
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "added another chess meme in intro.html"
$ git status

As all the changes I had made in intro-image branch seemed fine, I decided to merge this branch with the main branch.
$ git checkout main
$ git merge intro-image
This command resulted in a conflict between the 2 branches in intro.html, which, ofcourse, I created on purpose for the sake of learning.
Then I made necessary chanegs in the file of our concern and resolved the conflict.
$ git add intro.html
$ git commit -m "resolved conflicts"
$ git branch -d intro-image

Then I went to GitHub, created this repo, copied the URL and wrote the following command:
$ git remote add origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git~ 
This means that I want to add my remote repo(in my desktop) with the URL as an origin to my local repo on GitHub.
Now, to check whether this remote origin exists, I write:
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git~ (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git~ (push)

But then I realised that I didn't copy the URL correcctly. So, I removed remote origin.
$ git remote remove origin
$ git remote -v 
showed nothing, confirming that the remote origin got deleted.

$ git remote add origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git (push)

$ git branch -M main
$ git push -u origin main

And I was done.

Not yet, actually. I edited this README.md file on GitHub, and wanted to update my local Git repo as well.
$ git status
showed me:
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

nothing to commit, working tree clean.

$ git fetch origin
$ git log origin/main
$ git diff origin/main
$ git merge origin/main

$ git status
Now, it showed:
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean.

This can be done in another, much shorter way as well, by using the pull command, which is a combination of fetch and pull command.
$ git diff origin/main
$ git pull origin

That's it for this repo. üòâ
ok
