//written in main branch

# This repository is just made to teach myself Git.

2-7-24, 2:31pm :    Just learnt:

``` bash
$ git --version
```

``` bash
$ git config --global user.name "chandrima-hazra"
```

``` bash
$ git config --global user.email "*****@gmail.com"
```

``` bash
$ mkdir july-proj
```

``` bash
$ cd july-proj` (C:Users\user\july-proj)
```

Then initialised an empty Git repo in folder july-proj: 
``` bash
$ git init
```

then created a naked intro.html file and checked whether the changes I had made was tracked or not:
``` bash
$ git status
```

and then staged it to the repository: 
``` bash
$ git add intro.html
```

Then created this README.md file.

#

2:50pm : Now I've created a crappy-style.css file, to make my intro.html file feel less shameful. After that,

``` bash
$ git add --all
```
OR 
``` bash
$ git add -A
```

This staged both my newly added files, README.md and crappy-style.css into the repository.
#

3:18pm : Made my first commit into the repo. YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE TO STAGE YOUR COMMITS FIRST!!!
``` bash 
$ git commit -m "here's my first commit"
```

Then made a small change in intro.html file and checked the status.
``` bash
$ git status --short
```

and it showed `M intro.html`, M meaning modified.

so you can even commit changes without writing add command, as I am going to do now:
``` bash
$ git commit -a -m "updated README.md"
```
#
## To view history of all your commits:

``` bash
$ git log
```
It shows all the previous commits you have done for this repo, along with the SHA(Secure Hash Algorithm) sequence for each commit.

### Reverting back to any of the previous commits :
``` bash
$ git revert <SHA sequence (of the commit we want to revrt back to)>
```

#

//written in intro-image branch

## Creating a new branch 

4:48pm : I created a new branch named intro-image.

``` bash 
$ git branch intro-image
$ git checkout intro-image
```
OR
``` bash
$ git checkout -b intro-image
```

Then I added some relatable chess memes in intro.html.

``` bash
$ git add --all
```

``` bash
$ git status --short
```

```A  chess-meme1.png```

```A  chess-meme2.jpeg```

```M  crappy-style.css```

```M  intro.html```

``` bash
$ git commit -m "added some chess memes in intro.html"
```
#

### View the list of all the files/ folders in a repo/dir

`ls` command gives list of all the files present in the current dir.

#

5:32pm : made another branch named "just-remembered-something".

``` bash
$ git checkout -b just-remembered-something
```

``` bash
$ git branch
```

Then I made some changes in intro.html.

``` bash
$ git commit -a -m "not important to know, just too lazy to type a commit message"
```
#
## Merging with the main/master branch

Then I merged this branch with the main branch.
Before that I need to switch to the main branch.

``` bash
$ git checkout main
```

``` bash
$ git merge just-remembered-something
```

### Deleting a branch

Since both branches were now pointing to the same commit, I deleted the just-remembered-something branch.
``` bash
$ git branch -d just-remembered-something
```
#

Now, back to intro-image branch, just made some more changes to the intro.html, style.css and README.md files.

``` bash
$ git add -A
```

``` bash
$ git commit -m "added another chess meme in intro.html"
```

``` bash
$ git status
```

As all the changes I had made in intro-image branch seemed fine, I decided to merge this branch with the main branch.

``` bash
$ git checkout main
```

``` bash
$ git merge intro-image
```
#
##  Resolving conflicts when merging with main/master 

The merge command resulted in a conflict between the 2 branches in the file intro.html, which, ofcourse, I created on purpose for the sake of learning.
Then I made necessary chanegs in the file of our concern and resolved the conflict.

``` bash
$ git add intro.html
```

``` bash
$ git commit -m "resolved conflicts"
```

``` bash
$ git branch -d intro-image
```

#
## Configuring remote origin

Then I went to GitHub, created this repo, copied the URL and wrote the following command:
``` bash
$ git remote add origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git~
```

This means that I want to add my remote repo(in my desktop) with the URL as an origin to my local repo on GitHub.
Now, to check whether this remote origin exists, I write:

``` bash
$ git remote -v
```
and it showed: 

```origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git~ (fetch)```

```origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git~ (push)```

### Removing remote origin

But then I realised that I didn't copy the URL correctly. So, I removed remote origin.
``` bash
$ git remote remove origin
```
Now, 
``` bash
$ git remote -v
```
showed nothing, confirming that the remote origin got deleted.
Now, I added the remote orign with the correct URL.

``` bash
$ git remote add origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git
```

``` bash
$ git remote -v
```
which showed:

```origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git (fetch)```

```origin  https://github.com/hazraChandrima/learning-git.git (push)```


## Pushing my files to origin

``` bash
$ git branch -M main
```
The above command renames the current branch wto main.

``` bash
$ git push -u origin main
```

And I was done.

....pushing my files to the repository.

#

I then edited this README.md file on GitHub, and wanted to update my local Git repo as well. So, I have to pull the latest changes from the origin.

## Pulling changes from the origin

### Difference between local main and origin/main

``` bash
$ git status
```
showed me:

``` bash
On branch main
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
nothing to commit, working tree clean.
```

Now, to view the difference between local and origin:
``` bash
$ git log origin/main
```
``` bash
$ git diff origin/main
```

### Pulling from the origin

You can either do fetch and merge:
``` bash
$ git fetch origin
```

``` bash
$ git merge origin/main
```

``` bash
$ git status
```

Now, it showed:

``` bash
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean.
```

OR

This can be done in another, much shorter way as well, by using the pull command, which is a combination of fetch and merge command.

``` bash
$ git pull origin
```

#
## Forking a repository

1. Copy the original repository URL.
2. Fork the repo.
### Cloning a repository
3.
``` bash
$ git clone <original repo URL>
```
### Configuring remotes
4.
``` bash
$ git remote -v
```
we see that the remote origin is set to the original repository. By convention, remote origin must be set to the forked repo, and remote upstream should be set to the original repo. So we rename our remote origin to upstream.
``` bash
$ git remote rename origin upstream
```
5. Copy the URL of our own fork, and set remote origin to our forked repo.
``` bash
$ git add remote origin <forked repo URL>
```
#

That's it for this repo. üòâ
